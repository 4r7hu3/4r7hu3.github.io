## The Who 

Hey<img class="profile-picture" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/4r7hu3/4r7hu3.github.io/assets/img/logo.jpg">, thanks for visiting my portfolio! 

I'm currently an undergraduate student in Statistics (final semesters) at the Federal University of Ceará ([UFC](https://www.ufc.br/)), interested in Statistics headed to Data Science/Data Analytics, and skilled with:

- R (+3 years)
- Python (+2 years)
- Spreadsheets (+2 years)
- SQL (+1 year)

Lately, I've been focusing on learning R and Python in depth, mostly for data cleaning and modeling purposes. I also intend to master other tools required by the market, such as Power BI, AWS and GCP.

As for my hobbies and tastes, I enjoy a lot listening to music (classic rock + alternative/indie genres), watching movies and TV shows, reading a good book while having some coffee, and going out with my family and friends.

## Projects

In this section you can find some of my work. As a beginner, I try to do as many activities as I can, despite the lack of time in my day to day. Please, remember this page won't show everything I've done, but suggestions are always welcome!

### PET Estatística UFC

There, I developed mini-courses of Python, R and G. Sheets within data analysis and data engineering themes. Also acted as the group's treasurer and researcher.

- [Research Project](https://github.com/4r7hu3/pet-files/tree/main/pet-research).

### Data Science Learning

Here there are a few of my efforts to evolve my data science knowledge, using vacation activities, courses, and my curiosity in order to improve my knowledge and learn a bit more.

- [Vacation Activity](https://github.com/4r7hu3/data-science-learning/tree/main/Atividade%20de%20F%C3%A9rias): work made by PET Estatística, reproduced with slightly changes;
- [Best Sellings Analysis](https://github.com/4r7hu3/data-science-learning/tree/main/AED%20Amazon%20Best%20Sellings): my first project of my own, in which I wanted to get insights from books sold on Amazon (I'm a huge fan of Sci-Fi and Fantasy books);
- [ggplot2](https://github.com/4r7hu3/data-science-learning/tree/main/Visualization/ggplot2): a hands-on the most simple and efficient plot library I've worked with, as part of a Google certification;
- [Google](https://github.com/4r7hu3/data-science-learning/tree/main/Google): files from the Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate.

All of the files above, you can find on [this](https://github.com/4r7hu3/data-science-learning) public repo on GitHub, along with some other useful things.

### Databases

During the discipline of Information Systems and Databases, in a final test, I came up with the idea of building an app to help students of our graduation face the challenges of the course with materials, files, answered exercises and more. Given that, my group and I made a simple terminal application (written in Java + SQL through SQLite3) to present.

### College Files

I think it's interesting to keep some files during college time, for future consults or things like that. So I decided to create a repo and store there some archives. This way, I have my personal college library, with all important content I just saw in graduation.

- [College subjects](https://github.com/4r7hu3/cadeiras-graduacao).

### Summaries

Several times, I catch myself forgetting some things I really didn't want to, for example, statistical formulas and theorems (fundamental tools for college tests, lol). Thus, I decided to start to do summaries about every possible content I learn, not only college ones. It is a way to constantly exercise my brain, also working as fast manuals when needed.
