## About

---

Hi, thanks for visiting my portfolio! Currently, I'm a student of Statistics at the Federal University of Ceará [(UFC)](https://www.ufc.br/) dedicating to become a Data Analyst. I've chosen Statistics firstly because I was fascinated by its uses seen during high school, and secondly, because I discovered that Statisticians also work with technology, in which I'm equally passionate about. 

Before getting into college, I have studied many topics of Computer Science -- such as Data Bases and Operating Systems -- at [IFCE](https://ifce.edu.br/maracanau) through a technical course, but unfortunately, I had to quit it after the pandemic. However, arriving at the college with this previous knowledge opened up a lot of doors for me.

At UFC, I have several opportunities to improve what I know, while learning a lot with others too. In 2022, for instance, I was part of [PET Estatística](https://sites.google.com/view/petestatisticaufc/) group, developing both soft and hard skills alongside my colleagues, while facing the great natural difficulties imposed by the course. Now, I'm focusing on learning these softwares so required by the market: Excel and Power BI.

This page is still being improved, but feel free to find my work in [GitHub](https://github.com/4r7hu3) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arthursdelima)
