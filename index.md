## The Who

Hi<img class="profile-picture" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/4r7hu3/4r7hu3.github.io/assets/img/logo.jpg">, thanks for visiting my portfolio! Currently, I'm a student of Statistics at the Federal University of Ceará ([UFC](https://www.ufc.br/)) dedicating to become a Data Scientist. I've chosen Statistics firstly because I was fascinated by its uses seen during high school, and secondly, because I discovered that Statisticians also work with technology, in which I'm equally passionate about. 

Before getting into college, I have studied many topics of Computer Science --- such as Databases and Operating Systems --- at [IFCE](https://ifce.edu.br/maracanau) through a technical course, but unfortunately, I had to quit it after the pandemic. However, arriving at the college with this previous knowledge opened up a lot of doors for me.

At UFC, I have several opportunities to improve what I know, while learning a lot with others too. In 2022, for instance, I was part of [PET Estatística](https://sites.google.com/view/petestatisticaufc/) group, developing both soft and hard skills alongside my colleagues, while facing the great natural difficulties imposed by graduation. Now, I'm focusing on learning R and Python in depth, to improve my proficiency in these languages.

## Projects

In this section you can find some of my work. As a beginner, I try to do as many activities as I can, despite the lack of time in my day to day. Please, remember this page won't show everything I've done, but suggestions are always welcome!

### PET Estatística UFC

There, I developed mini-courses of Python, R and G. Sheets within data analysis and data engineering themes. Also acted as the group's treasurer and researcher.

- [Research Project](https://github.com/4r7hu3/pet-files/tree/main/pet-research).

### Python/Jupyter

Here there are a few of my efforts to get the most out of Python and Notebooks, using vacation activities and my curiosity in order to improve my knowledge and learn a bit more.

- [Vacation Activity](https://github.com/4r7hu3/data-science-learning/tree/main/Atividade%20de%20F%C3%A9rias): work made by PET Estatística, reproduced with slightly changes;
- [Best Sellings Analysis](https://github.com/4r7hu3/data-science-learning/tree/main/AED%20Amazon%20Best%20Sellings): my first project of my own, in which I wanted to get insights from books sold on Amazon (I'm a huge fan of Sci-Fi and Fantasy books).

### Databases

During the discipline of Information Systems and Databases, in a final test, I came up with the idea of building an app to help students of our graduation face the challenges of the course with materials, files, answered exercises and more. Given that, my group and I made a simple terminal application (written in Java + SQL through SQLite3) to present.

### College Files

I think it's interesting to keep some files during college time, for future consults or things like that. So I decided to create a repo and store there some archives. This way, I have my personal college library, with all important content I just saw in graduation.

### Summaries

Several times, I catch myself forgetting some things I really didn't want to, for example, statistical formulas and theorems (fundamental tools for college tests, lol). Thus, I decided to start to do summaries about every possible content I learn, not only college ones. It is a way to constantly exercise my brain, also working as fast manuals when needed.
