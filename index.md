Hey<img class="profile-picture" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/4r7hu3/4r7hu3.github.io/assets/img/logo.jpg">, thanks for visiting my portfolio! 

I'm currently an undergraduate student in Statistics (final semesters) at the Federal University of Ceará ([UFC](https://www.ufc.br/)), interested in Statistics headed to Data Science/Data Analytics, and skilled with:

- R (+3 years)
- Python (+2 years)
- Spreadsheets (+2 years)
- SQL (+1 year)

Lately, I've been focusing on learning R and Python in depth, mostly for data cleaning and modeling purposes. I also intend to master other tools required by the market, such as Power BI, AWS and GCP.

In the spare time, I enjoy a lot listening to music (classic rock + alternative/indie genres), watching movies and TV shows, reading a good book while having some coffee, and going out with my family and friends.

<br>
