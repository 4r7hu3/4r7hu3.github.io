### Streamlit Dashboard

Software like Power BI, Tableau and Looker Studio provide a relatively simple way to build dashboards, but offer less flexibility. Given that, libraries like *streamlit* or *dash* are able to fulfill the needs of more advanced users and problems.

### Python for data analysis

To stay updated in any subject, a believe the most efficient way is to constantly exercise and search for challenges related to it, also keeping regular readings. Here, you'll find some of my practice files.
