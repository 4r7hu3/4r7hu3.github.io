### Hands-On *ggplot2*

A hands-on the most simple and efficient plot library I’ve worked with, as part of a Google certification, and some additional tests guided by my curiosity. The Palmerpenguins classical dataset was used to elaborate several types of charts.

### Streamlit Dashboard

Software like Power BI, Tableau and Looker Studio provide a relatively simple way to build dashboards, but offer less flexibility. Given that, libraries like *streamlit* or *dash* are able to fulfill the needs of more advanced users and problems.
